# TODO: Import the necessary libraries
# You will need the 'requests' library and 'HTTPBasicAuth' from 'requests.auth'

# TODO: Define your username and password
# These are the credentials you will use for basic authentication

# TODO: secure your credentials in .env
#

# TODO: Make a GET request to 'https://api.github.com/user' using basic authentication
# Use the 'requests.get()' function and pass in the URL and your credentials
# Your credentials should be passed to the 'auth' parameter as an instance of 'HTTPBasicAuth'

# TODO: Print the response
# Use the '.json()' method of the response object to print the response in JSON format

# TODO: Handle possible exceptions
# Wrap your code in a try-except block to handle possible exceptions, such as a 'requests.exceptions.RequestException'

""" Here's the skeleton of the code you need to fill:"""
# import requests
# from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# def basic_auth():
