Logging in Python is a built-in module that allows you to track events in your application and record them in different outputs. It's a flexible system that you can configure to meet your needs. Here are the main components:

- **Logger**: This is the object that your application will directly interact with. It provides the interface that application code directly uses.

- **Handler**: Handlers send the log records (created by loggers) to the appropriate destination like console or a file.

- **Formatter**: Formatters specify the layout of log records in the final output.

## Logging Levels
1.  **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
2. **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
3. **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
4. **ERROR**: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
5. **CRITICAL**: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.


## Logging Best Practices

Here are some common best practices for logging in Python:

1. **Use the built-in logging module**: Python's built-in logging module is powerful and flexible. It provides all the functionality you need for most applications, so there's usually no need to use a third-party library.

2. **Configure logging at the application level**: It's a good practice to configure your loggers, handlers, and formatters at the application level. This ensures that all parts of your application are using the same logging configuration.

3. **Use different log levels appropriately**: The logging module provides several log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). Use these levels appropriately to categorize your log messages. For example, use DEBUG for detailed information for diagnosing problems, INFO for confirming things are working as expected, WARNING for indicating something unexpected happened, and ERROR and CRITICAL for indicating serious problems.

4. **Don't use the root logger directly**: The root logger is the base logger that all other loggers are derived from. It's a best practice to create and use your own logger(s) instead of using the root logger directly. This gives you more control and flexibility over your logging configuration.

5. **Use exception logging methods for exceptions**: The logging module provides methods for logging exceptions (`exception()`, `error()`, etc.). These methods automatically include exception information in the log message, which can be very helpful for debugging.

6. **Don't log sensitive information**: Be careful not to log sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII). This information could be exposed if your logs are not properly secured.

7. **Rotate your log files**: If you're logging to files, it's a good practice to rotate your log files periodically. This prevents your log files from growing indefinitely and consuming all your disk space. The `RotatingFileHandler` and `TimedRotatingFileHandler` classes in the logging module can help with this.

8. **Use structured logging for complex applications**: For complex applications or microservices architectures, consider using structured logging. Structured logs are easier to process and analyze programmatically. The `json` module can help you create structured log messages.

9. **Include context information in your log messages**: Including context information (like user ID, request ID, etc.) in your log messages can make it easier to correlate events and diagnose problems.

10. **Use asynchronous logging for performance-critical applications**: If logging is a bottleneck in your application, consider using asynchronous logging. This allows your application to continue processing while the log messages are being handled in the background. Be aware that this can make your logging configuration more complex and can potentially result in lost log messages if your application crashes.
