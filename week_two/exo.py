# TODO: Define a function called 'fetch_posts' that fetches posts from the API.
# The function should accept two parameters, 'page' and 'limit'.
# The 'page' parameter specifies the page number and the 'limit' parameter specifies the number of items per page.
# Make the 'page' and 'limit' parameters optional.
# For example, to fetch the first page with 10 items, you would set 'page' to 1 and 'limit' to 10.
# The function should print the number of posts fetched and the current page number.
# This will help in verifying that the pagination is working correctly.
# define the function here.
# TODO: Implement pagination by using the 'page' and 'limit' parameters in the API request.
# The 'page' parameter specifies the page number and the 'limit' parameter specifies the number of items per page.
# For example, to fetch the first page with 10 items, you would set 'page' to 1 and 'limit' to 10.

# Define the base URL
base_url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"

# TODO Send the request and store it in a variable called 'response'


# Todo Parse the response in a variable called 'posts'


# TODO: Print the number of posts fetched and the current page number.
# This will help in verifying that the pagination is working correctly.

# Todo Print the posts and display the title of each post


# TODO Fetch all posts without pagination


# TODO: Call the 'fetch_posts' function with different page numbers and limits to test the pagination.
# For example, you could fetch the first page with 10 items, then the second page with 10 items, and so on.
